This is yet another unfinished half-assed opinionated attpempt to resurrect Garnet.

NOTE: This won't even load or draw anything at all. 

I only put it up here in case you have been stricken with similar fool ideas and this could either save you work or dissuade you.

Most of the changes are for loading with ASDF, which since I don't even like
ASDF that much, is a little pointless. Other changes are to use packages in a
way that, seemed more sensible, but really isn't, since exporting where
something is defined actually seems more sensible. The files and directory
structure have been shifted slightly. Oh, and I think it definitely won't work
on a pre-darwin MacOS.
