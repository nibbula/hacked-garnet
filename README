Garnet stands for Generating an Amalgam of Real-time, Novel Editors and 
Toolkits. It was originally developed by the User Interface Software Group 
in the Human Computer Interaction Institute in the School of Computer Science 
at Carnegie Mellon University in the early to mid 1990s. It is an environment 
for creating interfaces to Common Lisp software.

In 1995, active support for Garnet at CMU was dropped as key people moved on 
and development focus shifted.  Various people made minor updates over the 
years, with Fred Gilham's version emerging as the most up to date.  The 
current version in sourceforge is based off of that distribution, and includes
more recent work by him as well.

************************
Building
************************

To build Garnet, set all the variables in the file garnet-loader.lisp to 
values consistent with your system.  Then, to build for CMUCL type:

make cmucl

or for Clisp:

make clisp

You can build for both versions with the command:

make all

and there should be no conflict between the two.

To clean out the built files, for CMUCL only type:

make cmuclclean

or for Clisp:

make clispclean

or both versions at once:

make clean


***************************
Running
***************************

To load Garnet and run the demos, do the following:

Clisp:  (tested with 2.29)

clisp -K full rundemos.lisp

CMUCL:  (tested with 18e)

lisp < rundemos.lisp

You can use this with both compiled and uncompiled Garnet.  Compiled,
however, will be many times faster.

Note:

   For some reason in clisp, when one wants to exit after loading Garnet by
   hand, the (quit) command doesn't work.  Instead, use (ext:quit).  CMUCL 
   doesn't appear to have this problem.
