A fake module directory for the multifont module whose files are linked in
from other directories.

@@@
We should probably clean this up. One of:
 - Multfont shouldn't even be an option and should just always be compiled,
   and multifont sources should just be in with the rest.
 - Multifont should be an option and the files should get compiled along with
   their home modules.
 - Move the files actually in here? [NOT SO GOOD]
